Working directory and Rstudio projects What is a working directory? While we usually explore the file system with a point-and-click file manager, how files are organized under the table is somewhat complicated, and when you need access a file, you will need a precise address of it, or in programming terms file path.\nA path could be either absolute (consider a full address) or relative (e.g., if you know which building (= reference point) we are talking about, 10th floor is not ambiguous). The working directory is the default reference point where R (or other computational tools) will use for its relative paths.\nIn other words, if you want to load a file, say it’s called data.txt. If you don’t specify the full path, R will go to your working directory to see if it can find data.txt.\n Checking and setting your working directory You can check the path of your working directory with getwd() (short for get working directory)\ngetwd() ## [1] \u0026quot;/Users/ycc/Dropbox/Docs/NYU/Teaching/SURP_2021/NYU_SURP_blogdown/content/handout/2022-06-13-prepare-your-computer-for-r\u0026quot;  Loading in files from your working directory Now that you have a directory, files inside that directory can be loaded in using functions like read.csv(). This function will take a comma-separated variable file (which you can make in Excel) and allow you to save it as a variable that R can work with.\n#mytestdata read.csv(\u0026quot;mytestdata.csv\u0026quot;) ## Day Count Group ## 1 1 12 1 ## 2 1 15 2 ## 3 2 8 1 ## 4 2 3 2 ## 5 3 10 1 ## 6 3 24 2 mytestdata \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;mytestdata.csv\u0026quot;) mytestdata ## Day Count Group ## 1 1 12 1 ## 2 1 15 2 ## 3 2 8 1 ## 4 2 3 2 ## 5 3 10 1 ## 6 3 24 2   Basic usage of R: Using it as a calculator Enter the following line of command in the console\n17 + 2.3 ## [1] 19.3 In programming, division is often written as slashes (/), while multiplication is written as asterisks (*).
