The functions that we’ve used so far have either been built into R such as mean(), dim(), sum(), and length(), or they have been loaded in as a package, such as dplyr::filter(), dplyr::summarize(), and ggplot::qplot().\nLet’s now look up the help menu for the function seq(). What does it do?\nhelp(seq) Let’s run this function with default values:\n#Uncomment this line to see what happens if you don\u0026#39;t include any values: #seq() #Let\u0026#39;s run this line to see what happens when you include only a single value: seq(5) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 Let’s include three numbers without explicitly calling each argument:\nseq(5,10,2) ## [1] 5 7 9 #This is the same as running: seq(from = 5, to = 10, by = 2) ## [1] 5 7 9 Let’s change up the order now:\n#This will also produce values that are equivalent: seq(to = 10, by = 2, from = 5) ## [1] 5 7 9 #But this will not: #seq(10, 2, 5) Practice Save a vector of values from 12 to 200, increasing by 4. Then print the last 10 values of this vector.\n#define your variable as the output of seq() #look at the documentation for tail() #print the last 10 values using tail()  Writing your own function We can write functions as well as using them. Today we’ll start off with a simple code to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n#define your variable celcius \u0026lt;- 20 #calculate your new value farenheit \u0026lt;- 9/5 * celcius + 32 #print the new value farenheit ## [1] 68 Now let’s turn this into a function, using the function() function. Keep in mind that functions follow essentially the format of\n\\[y=f(x)\\]\nwhich can also be read as:\n\\[output = myfunction(input)\\]\nWhen we write this in code, we define the name of the function (below it’s c2f) as function(input){}, where inside the curly brackets {} there is the actual calculation. We then use the function return() to designate to the function what to output, which is our “y” in the above formula.\nc2f \u0026lt;- function(celcius) { farenheit = 9/5 * celcius + 32 return(farenheit) } What happens if we run this without an argument?\n#Run the following code: c2f() We need to include arguments for celcius:\n#Try explicitly stating the value c2f(celcius = 10) ## [1] 50 #What happens if we don\u0026#39;t define celcius? c2f(10) ## [1] 50 Finally, we can actually include a default when we create this function. Let’s add in something to c2f().\nc2f_adv \u0026lt;- function(celcius = 0) { farenheit \u0026lt;- 9/5 * celcius + 32 return(farenheit) } #now run the code without an argument to see what happens c2f_adv() ## [1] 32  Functions with two arguments: If we include x and y into the equation, we can set two variables values:\nmultiply \u0026lt;- function(x, y){x*y} Now we can run this, but it won’t work if we don’t give two arguments:\n#This does not work without defaults #multiply() #This will multiply 2 and 3: multiply(2,3) ## [1] 6 If we rewrite this function, then it will work if defaults are set:\nmultiply2 \u0026lt;- function(x = 2, y = 4){x*y} #This will multiply the default arguments multiply2() ## [1] 8 #This will multiply the inputs multiply2(3,10) ## [1] 30 #What happens if you only include one number? multiply2(10) ## [1] 40 multiply2(y = 10) ## [1] 20   Data Types So far we’ve been able to run calculations using variables, and used read.csv() to take in a character (the name of your file) that is converted into a data frame. We’ve also mentioned that data frame columns must be vectors of the same “type”. But what are the other data types that R can use?\nSome basic data types:\n Characters (char): “string” of text, which has the value of the text\n Numbers (num): overall class of numbers, which includes integers and doubles\n Integers (int): numbers without decimal points (takes less space)\n Doubles (dbl): floating point numbers, or those with precision (takes more space)\n Factors (fact): categorical elements which can be ordered (this sounds weird, but we’ll explain more later)\n  examplestring \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;This is a string of text\u0026quot; exampledouble \u0026lt;- 26.2 exampleinteger \u0026lt;- 5 #We can find out the data types by running typeof() typeof(examplestring) ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot; #What data types are exampledouble and exampleinteger? typeof(exampledouble) ## [1] \u0026quot;double\u0026quot; typeof(exampleinteger) ## [1] \u0026quot;double\u0026quot; #Notice that exampleinteger is also listed as a double; this is because R will automatically store numbers as doubles, and converts between numeric classes automatically realinteger \u0026lt;- as.integer(exampleinteger) typeof(realinteger) ## [1] \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot; When plotting, data types will change how plots view your data. For example, characters will often be unique values without order, numbers will often be continuous rather than discrete, and ordered alphabetically, and factors will be discrete and maintain an order. We will learn more about this soon, but we can use an example with qplot (which we’ve reviewed).\npenguins \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;penguins.csv\u0026quot;) # How many colors are there when we color by island? qplot(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, data = penguins, color = island) ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point). # How many colors are there when we color by bill depth? qplot(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, data = penguins, color = bill_depth_mm) ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

So far, we’ve worked with data frames in R. Each data frame is really a set of rows and columns with values populated, and these can be broken down into what are called vectors. A vector is simply a one-dimensional set of something that can have at minimum length 1.\nWe can create vectors using the function c(), for concatenate.\nFirstVector \u0026lt;- c(4,20,10,21,60,3,14,63,9,6) FirstVector ## [1] 4 20 10 21 60 3 14 63 9 6 This vector has a length, and each number has an index within that vector. In the upper right, you can see that your FirstVector values are 1:10 and numeric. We can also use the length() function to find out how many elements we have in our vector.\nlength(FirstVector) ## [1] 10 If we wanted to identify the first value, we could use square brackets, ‘[]’, to identify that value. R will print the value that corresponds with that number.\nFirstVector[1] ## [1] 4 If we wanted to find the fifth value, we would use the following:\nFirstVector[5] ## [1] 60 #What is the 9th element in the vector? Write your code below: To make a set of numbers that is in a sequence by one, we can just use a ‘:’ to tell R to print that sequence. We can make a new vector using this:\nSecondVector \u0026lt;- 1:10 SecondVector ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Similarly, we can subset using the ‘:’ to ask R to give us a set of numbers to index by, such as the first three elements in the FirstVector.\nFirstVector[1:3] ## [1] 4 20 10 #Find the last 4 elements of SecondVector. Print your code below:  Indexing Data Frames If we wanted to make a data frame from vectors that we already have, we can use the data.frame() function to combine vectors of the same size. If the vectors are different sizes, R won’t know what to do with the extra slots and will give you an error.\n#Making a data frame from vectors NewDataFrame \u0026lt;- data.frame(Random = FirstVector, Index = SecondVector) NewDataFrame ## Random Index ## 1 4 1 ## 2 20 2 ## 3 10 3 ## 4 21 4 ## 5 60 5 ## 6 3 6 ## 7 14 7 ## 8 63 8 ## 9 9 9 ## 10 6 10 Instead of using length() to find out the size of a data frame, we would need to find the dimensions of that data frame. We briefly covered this function in earlier sessions: you can use dim().\ndim(NewDataFrame) ## [1] 10 2 The output of dim() is a vector, which gives the number of rows (first number) and the number of columns (second number). An easy way to remember this is “railroad car”, which always has R before C, or rows before columns.\nWhat if we wanted to find the first row of our data frame? We could use square brackets again, but this time we would need to add a column in between our row argument and our column argument. To select all of the values of one row or column, leave the element (before or after the comma) blank.\n#The following code will give the first row: NewDataFrame[1,] ## Random Index ## 1 4 1 #This next code will give the second column: NewDataFrame[,2] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 What if we wanted to find the first column and fourth row element? We would indicate both of these numbers in square brackets:\nNewDataFrame[4,1] ## [1] 21 #Find the third element of the second column below: #Find the last 3 elements of the first column below:  Using column names with $ If you wanted to refer to a column by name, you can do so with the $ operator. We can print the second column as such:\nNewDataFrame$Index ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 If we wanted to select the second element of the Index column, we could do so using the square brackets as we did before; in this case, though, we now have a vector (the column) rather than a data frame, so we only need one dimension in our square brackets:\nNewDataFrame$Index[2] ## [1] 2 #Find the fourth element of the Random column below:   Logicals A review of Booleans Booleans are true/false statements that are evaluated by R. TRUE is encoded by a 1, and FALSE is encoded by a 0. R recognizes the words “TRUE” and “FALSE” when they are capitalized.\nWe can evaluate two numbers by using the ‘==’ sign between them:\n2 == 2 ## [1] TRUE 2 == 3 ## [1] FALSE We can also find the numbers in a vector that are equal to a certain number:\nFirstVector == 4 ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE Note that only the first element of FirstVector is 4; the rest are not, and so this evaluates to FALSE.\nWe can also use the \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; to evaluate, and \u0026lt;= and \u0026gt;=:\nFirstVector \u0026lt; 10 ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE # Find all of the values of SecondVector that are greater than or equal to 4 # Find all of the values of FirstVector that are less than 5 We can also evaluate two vectors to see if they have the same values:\nFirstVector == NewDataFrame[,1] ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE #Below, use \u0026#39;!=\u0026#39; to ask if FirstVector is NOT equal to the first column of NewDataFrame Finally, we can compare if two columns are equal in our data frame:\nNewDataFrame$Random == NewDataFrame$Index ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE   Subsetting Subsetting by values We’ve done this using dplyr in the past; we can take a data frame and filter it by a certain value. Without using the dplyr package, we can also do this based on the rows and column indices. Keep in mind that if you’re using the full name of the column,\n#First we can print the indices where the Random column equals 4 NewDataFrame$Random == 4 ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #By placing the true values in the square brackets, this code prints the rows where Rnadom is equal to 4 NewDataFrame[NewDataFrame$Random == 4,] ## Random Index ## 1 4 1 #Below, find the rows where the Random column is greater than 50 #Next, find the rows in which the Random column value is less than OR equal to the Index column value Of course, this can also be done using dplyr, but with naming columns and not the data frame:\nlibrary(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;dplyr\u0026#39; ## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:stats\u0026#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union NewDataFrame %\u0026gt;% filter(Random == 4) ## Random Index ## 1 4 1  Putting it together Before we move on to visualizing, we can also create a new column in our data frame using $, and we can populate that by using booleans:\nNewDataFrame$NewColumn \u0026lt;- NewDataFrame$Random \u0026gt;= NewDataFrame$Index NewDataFrame ## Random Index NewColumn ## 1 4 1 TRUE ## 2 20 2 TRUE ## 3 10 3 TRUE ## 4 21 4 TRUE ## 5 60 5 TRUE ## 6 3 6 FALSE ## 7 14 7 TRUE ## 8 63 8 TRUE ## 9 9 9 TRUE ## 10 6 10 FALSE   Visualizing the subset Plotting subsetted values If you wanted to plot only specific values, you could use these same booleans inside the functions to plot.

If we look at the function for qplot, it will give us the options for our plots.\nWe can do this by either running help() or ?, as done below:\nhelp(qplot) ?qplot This has lots of options, but the examples show where they have options for size and color. We’ll get into how to use these (and more!) in ggplot later, but you can explore how to visualize your own data using qplot, as long as you remember to load ggplot2 into your workspace.\nYou’ll notice that there’s an option for geom.

Since we are interested in body weight, we might want throw away rows with missing body weight…\n# You might want to try filtering for body_mass_g== NA adelie %\u0026gt;% filter(body_mass_g == NA) ## [1] species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm ## [5] flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex year ## \u0026lt;0 rows\u0026gt; (or 0-length row.names) What is happening? Remember that we said R treats NA very differently. As a matter of fact, almost every operation gives you NA when NA is involved.\n# Try these 5 == NA ## [1] NA 3 \u0026gt; NA ## [1] NA \u0026quot;North America\u0026quot; != NA ## [1] NA 3.1415926 \u0026lt;= NA ## [1] NA Since NA is missing data, this actually makes sense:\n5 == NA is like asking “is 5 equal to something I don’t know?”, and the answer has to be “I don’t know”.\nSo, how do we ask R if it doesn’t know something or has an NA there? We use is.na().\nis.na(NA) ## [1] TRUE is.na(\u0026quot;National Academy\u0026quot;) ## [1] FALSE You can use is.na() with filter() to find the rows where body weight is NA.\n# Use is.na() to get rows with NA in body_mass_g adelie %\u0026gt;% filter(is.na(body_mass_g)) ## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g ## 1 Adelie Torgersen NA NA NA NA ## sex year ## 1 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 2007 How do we select all other rows then? In R, ! flips a logical value, and you can pronounce it as not.\n# Not TRUE !TRUE ## [1] FALSE # Not FALSE !FALSE ## [1] TRUE # Flipping (3 \u0026gt; 5) !(3 \u0026gt; 5) ## [1] TRUE We can use ! to find rows that are not NA.\n# How many Adelie penguins have their body mass recorded? adelie %\u0026gt;% filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) %\u0026gt;% count() ## n ## 1 151   Extended reading: Dealing with missing values Depends on what you work with, you might not always want to drop missing values.\nIf you are not going to throw those data away, you’ll need to ask yourself questions like “Does missing value appear randomly?”, and decide how to best deal with them.\nIf you are interested, Hadley Wickham has a section in his book R for Data Science discussing this.\n  Group your data for further analysis Let’s say we are interested in how body weight differs between islands. To perform this analysis, we might want to calculate the median and standard deviation of body mass per island.\nTo indicate how dplyr should group your data, we use group_by() to tell it which column contains the group labels.\nLet’s assign the grouped data to another object named adelie_per_island\nadelie_per_island \u0026lt;- adelie %\u0026gt;% filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) %\u0026gt;% group_by(island)  Get summary statistics with summarize() Now that we grouped the data, we can calculate the summary statistics.\nThe syntax for summarize() is as follows:\n# You tell summarize() which functions to use on which column adelie_per_island %\u0026gt;% summarize(mean(body_mass_g)) ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## island `mean(body_mass_g)` ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Biscoe 3710. ## 2 Dream 3688. ## 3 Torgersen 3706. By default, the column names of the summary table is the function call we gives to summarize(), which could be a bit ugly. We can rename the columns by:\nadelie_per_island %\u0026gt;% summarize(mean_bw = mean(body_mass_g)) ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## island mean_bw ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Biscoe 3710. ## 2 Dream 3688. ## 3 Torgersen 3706. The summary statistics that we use the most often are:\n Arithmetic mean (mean()) Median (median()) Standard deviation (sd())  Let’s summarize the data with median and standard deviation per island.\n# Summarize the Adelie subset per island with the median and standard deviation # of the body mass adelie_per_island %\u0026gt;% summarize(bw_median = median(body_mass_g), bw_sd = sd(body_mass_g)) ## # A tibble: 3 × 3 ## island bw_median bw_sd ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Biscoe 3750 488. ## 2 Dream 3575 455. ## 3 Torgersen 3700 445. What if you don’t group? adelie %\u0026gt;% filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) %\u0026gt;% summarize(bw_median = median(body_mass_g), bw_sd = sd(body_mass_g)) ## bw_median bw_sd ## 1 3700 458.5661  What if you want to group with another grouping variable? # Let\u0026#39;s group with sex adelie %\u0026gt;% filter(!is.na(body_mass_g), !is.na(sex)) %\u0026gt;% group_by(sex) %\u0026gt;% summarize(bw_median = median(body_mass_g), bw_sd = sd(body_mass_g)) ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## sex bw_median bw_sd ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 female 3400 269. ## 2 male 4000 347.   A picture is worth a thousand words While it’s great to have summary statistics, oftentimes a quick visualization of our data will be very helpful.\nqplot() provided by ggplot2 is designed for this purpose and can be easily incorporated into your pipeline.\nExample: a quick scatter/strip plot per island Let’s plot something with points on a plane where the x-axis is the islands and the y-axis is the body weight.\n# Load ggplot2 library(ggplot2) adelie_per_island %\u0026gt;% qplot(data = ., x = island, y = body_mass_g, geom = \u0026quot;point\u0026quot;) There several required arguments for qplot():\n data: The data you want to plot. x: The column name of the variable you want to use as the x-axis y: The column name of the variable you want to use as the y-axis color: The column name of the variable you want to color your plot by geom: Short for “geometry”, the type of plots you want to do.
