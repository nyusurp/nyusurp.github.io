# Do (not) bother to pick a language

---

- Languages are often more similar than different

--

```r
# R
model <- lm(x = data[["x"]], y = data[["y"]])
```
--

```python
# Python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x = data['x'], y = data['y'])
```
--

```julia
# julia
model = lm(@formula(y~x), data)
```

--

```octave
# MATLAB
model = fitlm(data, 'y', 'x');
```

# Goals of this workshop


- Help you to do whatever you want to do with your data in R

--

- Give you the lever to work with thousands to millions of data entries (`dplyr` and `tidyr`)
  
--

- Visualize your data in multiple perspectives with minimal struggle (`ggplot2`)
  
--

- Test your hypotheses with statistics
